## User Experience (UX)

Inspyre is designed to feel like a creative home — a platform where users don’t just consume content, but actively participate in an ongoing exchange of ideas and inspiration.

_Effortless Discovery:_ From the moment users land on the homepage, they’re greeted with a dynamic gallery of visual and written content, curated for exploration. Browsing is fast, intuitive, and immersive — with minimal clutter and maximum focus on the work.

_Creative Expression:_ Users can easily create and share posts, whether it’s artwork, photography, short stories, or thought pieces. Image-based and text-based content types are both first-class citizens, each with tailored editing interfaces.

_Personalized Profiles:_ Each user gets a customizable profile with a bio, profile tags to highlight your creative mediums, a profile photo, and a clean portfolio-style layout. Their posts, followers, and following lists are all easily viewable and interactable.

_Community Engagement:_ Through likes, comments, follows and direct messages, users can connect and build communities around shared passions.

_Mobile-Ready Design:_ Inspyre scales gracefully to any device, with thoughtful mobile UX — from responsive navigation to swipe-friendly browsing.

Inspyre aims to be more than just a platform — it’s a creative space that puts the user’s work front and center, while offering just enough social functionality to foster genuine connection and growth.

### User Stories

When originally designing Inspyre, I created a Project (organised via a kanban board) in GitHub, containing a list of User Stories that set out my intended features. These User Stories can be viewed [here](https://github.com/users/MattMiles95/projects/8/views/1).

## Logic

I discuss the logic for Inspyre (including my Entity Relationship Diagrams), in the README for my backend repo. [Click here]() to check it out.

### Wireframes

Below are the wireframes I used to create the initial layout and design for Inspyre. These include the the sign up page, the homepage (on desktop and mobile device), the profile page and the chat page.
